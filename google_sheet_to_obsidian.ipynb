One of the kite-twins bragged that that she'd stolen the borders from kingdoms, and the other that she'd taken the roads from crossroads. The magpie told all the colours he'd taken that are no longer found in the world, and the laughingthrush topped that with the tales of the sights she'd stolen. But when the glitter-winged seventh of their number told them what he'd stolen, they all were shocked into silence. They fell upon him and stripped him of his wings and drove him from the sky. So he, and what he stole, are gone from the world, and now we cannot even name them, but still we feel their lack. [Ramsund]\",\n",

       "    'Details': \"A confidential journal kept by Greene, former Nocturnal Branch Superindent but, by 1903, Librarian of the House. Greene has kept his journal in Hyksos, presumably as an extra measure of privacy. In 1903, the House co-operated closely with the Branch, and Greene was the public face of that co-operation. In private, however, Greene is clearly disillusioned with the Branch, which he increasingly regards as irresponsible. He is especially concerned about the construction of a 'suppressive mechanism' beneath Brancrug Gaol, and its likely occupant. 'Hours and Names are dangerous,' he writes, 'but at least our dealings have the benefit of long experience. An Hour who acts before she is born - who leaves those places she has never entered - if her Names walk the world already, how can we understand their courses and their capabilities?' The last entries alternate between calculations (tides, dates, financial calculations) and expressions of fevered longing for 'A.F'. It seems that Greene intends to run away with A.F., and some of the calculations imply that he has been embezzling funds to that end, under cover of the chaos caused by the Ortucchio Incident and the subsequent reorganisation of Nocturnal Branch into the Suppression Bureau... The entries, however, stop abruptly before the year's end. It's not clear whether Greene did in fact abscond with funds and fond friend, or whether he abandoned this journal for other reasons.\",\n",

For four years, since his adoption from a Bristol orphanage, Illopoly served as Strathcoyne's pupil and protégé, but his relationship with this austere and secretive man was always complicated. His journal confides: 'I still think Fraser's intentions are good. Certainly he agrees. But I never understood the final goal of his investigations. He was never prepared to enlighten me. And good intentions or not, I can no longer bear this dream of eyes. We have agreed to part, almost amicably.' Illopoly left Perugia in 1909 without completing his degree. He had long lost interest in his studies, and the latter half of the journal is concerned with his studies of Umbrian folk-songs, and notes towards his own compositions (which are of widely varying quality). One of the better ones, 'In the Marshes of Night', suggests he visited the site of the old Lake Fucinus near Ortucchio…\"},\n",
