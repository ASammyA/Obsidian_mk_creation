One of the kite-twins bragged that that she'd stolen the borders from kingdoms, and the other that she'd taken the roads from crossroads. The magpie told all the colours he'd taken that are no longer found in the world, and the laughingthrush topped that with the tales of the sights she'd stolen. But when the glitter-winged seventh of their number told them what he'd stolen, they all were shocked into silence. They fell upon him and stripped him of his wings and drove him from the sky.

He is especially concerned about the construction of a 'suppressive mechanism' beneath Brancrug Gaol, and its likely occupant.

For four years, since his adoption from a Bristol orphanage, Illopoly served as Strathcoyne's pupil and protégé, but his relationship with this austere and secretive man was always complicated. His journal confides: 'I still think Fraser's intentions are good. Certainly he agrees. But I never understood the final goal of his investigations. He was never prepared to enlighten me. And good intentions or not, I can no longer bear this dream of eyes. We have agreed to part, almost amicably.' Illopoly left Perugia in 1909 without completing his degree. He had long lost interest in his studies, and the latter half of the journal is concerned with his studies of Umbrian folk-songs, and notes towards his own compositions (which are of widely varying quality). One of the better ones, 'In the Marshes of Night', suggests he visited the site of the old Lake Fucinus near Ortucchio…\"},\n",
